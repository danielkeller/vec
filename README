vec is a programming language designed to work on vector, rather than scalar, data.

It is not object oriented, all data is POD.
Built in data types include tuples, lists (fixed and variable) and tensors.
A rich type inference system is included, with support for automatic type inference. Template functions are planned.
The (not yet added) centerpiece of the language is backtick, the foreach operator.
This will allow automaitc iteration of an expression statement over a vector type.
For example, used in combination with $, the concatenation operator, partitioning in quicksort would look like:

(`list < piv_val ? less : more) $= `list;

where list, less, and more are list types and piv_val is a numeric type.


[the v2 branch is a total rewrite using custom parser and lexer, and better structure inspired by clang.]
