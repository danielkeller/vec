//TODO: don't expand types until sema phase.
//then, recursively expand along with everything else

//it might be nice to be able to output a compunit before
//sema so as to skip parsing of standard libs every time

//could do variadic templates:
//ie type foo?[A, B, ...] = [A first, B second, {[...]}];
//or whatever

//add storage duration specifier agg
//acts like static except initializer is run on first call to agg function
